I"Œ<p>I made a video for my project Memory.dll, the C# library to help people easily make a game cheat trainer in C#. In the video I was making a World of Warcraft Vanilla (version 1.12.1) game cheat trainer. Since the video, Iâ€™ve been asked to release the trainer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that project was made specifically for the videoâ€™s demonstrative purposes. But as of lately Iâ€™ve started giving my Patronâ€™s more rewards for being loyal members. As of today, I have released the cheat trainer to my Patreon members <em>exclusively</em>! So if you want to try this trainer today, sign up for a Patreon membership.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Warp to corpse</li>
  <li>anti-root</li>
  <li>Infinite Jump</li>
  <li>Super Fly</li>
  <li>Air Swim</li>
  <li>No Falling Damage</li>
  <li>Wall Climb</li>
  <li>Change Falling Speed</li>
  <li>Change Running Speed</li>
  <li>Change Swim Speed</li>
  <li>Disable Warden</li>
  <li>Disable runspeed change detection</li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot guarantee you wonâ€™t get banned from the servers for using these. They do come with anti-warden and anti-runspeed detection, but it all depends how the serverâ€™s built their anti-cheating software.</p>
