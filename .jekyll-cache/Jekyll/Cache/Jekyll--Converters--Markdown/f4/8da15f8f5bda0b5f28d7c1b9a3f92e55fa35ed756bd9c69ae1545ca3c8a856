I":<p>I have a few Windows 10 PCs and a Macbook that I use for software development. Sometimes I need to update my Nintendo Switch games for my SX OS. I know there are some other meathods of transferring games, but this seems to be the fastest method. Also when updating SX OS the system needs to reboot as well.</p>
