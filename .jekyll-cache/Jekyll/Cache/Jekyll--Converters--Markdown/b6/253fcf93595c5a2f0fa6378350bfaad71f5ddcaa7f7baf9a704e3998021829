I"¤<p>If you have HENKaku on your PSVita and use something like PKGj to get your games, DLC, etc. you may see a (3.61+) in the contentâ€™s title. This is because HENKaku can only be installed on PSVita or PSTV systems that are at 3.60 firmware version. You can technically update from 3.60 to 3.65 once you have HENKaku installed. But still newer games or updates will sometimes require 3.67 or 3.69 firmware versions.</p>
