This article has technically been removed for legal purposes. If you want to use your Android device to write Amiibo data to an NFC device, you should look at the [TagMo open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/HiddenRamblings/TagMo). Check that project page for more information. Please note, that project was not created by me.

If you're wondering what happened to my YouTube video, it was taken down by Nintendo.
