* You will now see a progress bar, and once it is complete it will either say it has finished OR the program will crash! This is ok, as the program has finished it’s process.
* Put the hard drive back in to your Xbox 360 console, turn it on, and play an Xbox original game. It might prompt you for a small 5mb patch. Go ahead and download/install the patch.
