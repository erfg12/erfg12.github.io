It is now possible to install Wii U backed up games to a USB hard drive! This will be different then how you would do this on PS3 or Xbox360. You will not be placing ISO files on to your USB drive, instead you will be installing games through the system via homebrew app on to the USB drive. You also do not need to download ISO files from third party sites like Mega or Google Drive.
