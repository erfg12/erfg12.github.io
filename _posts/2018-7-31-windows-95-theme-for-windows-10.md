The zip packages on this page have assets and documents for theming a Windows 10 computer to look like an older operating system. Watch the YouTube video and read the documentation provided to get an understanding of how this process works. If at any time you want to undo the theme, uninstall Classic-Shell and run the Uninstall-Theme.bat file.

The demigod customizer program may give you errors or warnings when customizing some of the system tray icons, and this is an issue I have seen before.
