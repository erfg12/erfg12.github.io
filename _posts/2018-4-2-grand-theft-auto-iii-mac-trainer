The .slice file requires Bit-Slicer. The app can run at any time. It has a task that checks for the game. Once it finds the game running, it will start reading the process ID and modifying values. These are not permanent changes, it modifies the process.

You can download [Bit Slicer](https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Bit-Slicer/releases) and use this [.slice table](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4YtK9YXaHvQVlhtbndqWlJDMlE?usp=sharing) OR, you can use [my cheat trainer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4YtK9YXaHvQVlhtbndqWlJDMlE?usp=sharing)!
